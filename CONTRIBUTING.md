# Contributing to mbdns

We welcome contributions to `mbdns` of any kind, including documentation, functional patches, bug reports, issues, feature requests, feature implementations, pull requests, etc.

## Building mbdns

Run [src/build-test](/src/build-test) to build a single binary from your git checkout. `go build` will place it into `../bin/mbdns`.

Run [src/build-rel RELEASE_NAME](/src/build-rel) if you'd like to build all supports binaries for a release. The release script will put the current git revision for `HEAD` into `BuildVersion` if you don't supply `RELEASE_NAME`. `go build` will place binaries into `../bin/RELEASE_NAME`.

## Current supported platform configs

While there's no golang code in `mbdns` that isn't portable to any platform that golang supports, the release build script only builds for platforms we've tested and are known to work.

Those configs are:

| GOOS    | GOARCH | Hardware and OS platform(s)         |
| :-----: | :----: | :---------------------------------- |
| linux   | arm    | QNAP                                |
| linux   | mipsle | Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X, EdgeOS v1.10 |
| darwin  | amd64  | macOS 10.13, iMac 5K                |
| freebsd | amd64  | freenas/11.1-stable, HP gen8 G1610T |
| linux   | amd64  | Ubuntu 18.04 LTS                    |

## Golang requirements

`mbdns` has no special golang requirements. Releases are currently generated by `go version go1.11 darwin/amd64`.
